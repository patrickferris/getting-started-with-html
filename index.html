    <b>Intro to Programming Nanodegree</b><br><br>

These notes are for the
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000">Intro to Programming Nanodegree</a>
offered by <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>.
The aim of the program is to impart fundamental programming knowledge and skills that programmers use.
While the Intro to Programming Nanodegree doesn't prepare students for a specific role, it seems like a great starting point.<br><br>

In short, I hope this course helps me figure out the best way to get ahead without working too hard.<br><br>

<b>Notes: The Basics of Web and HTML</b><br><br>

<b>Components of the Web</b><br><br>

The web consists of the following:<br>
0. You - none of this matters without people using the web.<br>
1. Computer and browser - for example, I'm typing this in a window in the Chrome browser on my MacBook Pro laptop.<br>
2. The Internet - a global system of computers that use a protocol called HTTP to communicate. (I'm getting ahead of myself.)<br>
3. HTTP - hypertext transfer protocol, the protocol that is the foundation of the web.<br>
4. Servers - computers optimized for hosting files.<br><br>

<b>How does it all work together?</b><br><br>
You open a <em>browser</em> (like <a href="www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>)
on your <em>laptop</em> (like I said, I use a <a href="store.apple.com/us/buy-mac/macbook-pro">Macbook Pro</a>).
In the address bar, you enter a <em>URL</em> (oops, should have mentioned that one earlier - 
more info <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+http&oq=what+is+http">here</a>)
that tells your computer what <em>server</em> (like <a href="google.com">google.com</a>) to access.
<em>HTTP</em> is the protocol Chrome uses to send requests to - and receives responses from - the server.<br><br>

<b>Tags and Elements</b><br><br>

One of the first things we learned about is tags and elememts.
A <em>tag</em> is a hidden keyword that tells the browser how to format content.
An <em>element</em> consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.<br><br>

Some example are the bold tag, <b>b</b>, and the emphasis tag, <em>em</em>.<br><br>

There are other types of tags that don't need to be closed. The br tag adds a line break.
The img tag is used to embed images, like I added above.
The a tag is used to add <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+an+html+link&oq=what+is+an+html+link">links</a>.
<br><br>

<b>Inline vs Block</b><br><br>

Some tags like b, em, and even br are inline tags, which means they are normally displayed without line breaks.<br><br>

Other tags like p and div, are block tags. That means they are their own elements and can have a specified height and width.<br><br>

OK, that's it for now. Keep up the good work and don't let the turkeys get you down!<br><br>
